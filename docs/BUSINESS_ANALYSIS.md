# Business Model Analysis: ZIP Platform & RentalVerify Service

## Executive Summary

### Platform Overview
ZIP (See it Before You Sign) is a two-sided marketplace platform connecting property renters with property owners, integrated with RentalVerify - a third-party property verification service. The platform addresses a critical pain point in the rental market: the inability to physically inspect properties before signing leases, particularly for remote or international renters.

### Core Value Proposition
- **For Renters**: Verified property listings with comprehensive documentation (photos, videos, 360° walkthroughs, inspection reports) before committing to a lease
- **For Property Owners**: Access to a broader tenant pool, including remote/international renters, with verification services that build trust
- **For Verification Operators**: Revenue opportunity through on-site property verification services

### Market Opportunity
The platform targets the growing remote work and international relocation market, where traditional in-person property viewings are not feasible. With rental scams costing victims millions annually, ZIP positions itself as a trusted intermediary providing transparency and verification.

## Business Model

### Two-Sided Marketplace Model

ZIP operates as a **two-sided marketplace** connecting:

The platform creates value by:

- **B2B**: ZIP contracts with RentalVerify to provide verification services
- **B2C**: Tenants pay for verification packages when booking properties
- **Service Delivery**: Local operators conduct on-site verifications

1. Tenants (paying for verification)

## Services

What the business does for customers: the core offerings of the ZIP platform.

### 1. Marketplace: Property Discovery & Listing

- **For renters (tenants):** Browse rental listings (filter by city, type, price, etc.), view full details, save properties, and see which are verified.
- **For property owners:** List properties (photos, description, price, location, amenities) and reach a broader tenant pool, including remote and international renters.

**In short:** Connects people looking for a place to rent with people offering rentals; reduces search costs and expands reach for both sides.

### 2. Property Verification (RentalVerify)

When a renter cannot visit in person, they can **pay for an on-site verification**. A local operator visits the property and produces a report (photos, checklist, and optionally video/360°). The renter receives proof the property exists, matches the listing, and (by package) that utilities work and the landlord is who they claim to be.

**Three paid packages:**

| Package | Price | What the renter gets |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| **Standard** | $149 USD | 15+ photos, checklist, landlord ID confirmation, report in 48 hours. |
| **Comprehensive** | $249 USD | 30+ photos, 5-min video, 360° walkthrough, full checklist with notes, utility check, landlord Q&A, report in 24 hours. |
| **Premium** | $399 USD | 50+ photos, 10-min video, interactive 360°, full checklist and utility/appliance checks, landlord interview summary, same-day report, priority scheduling within 24 hours. |

**Who does the work:** Local **verification operators** (contracted partners) perform the visit and produce the report; ZIP/RentalVerify coordinates and delivers it to the tenant.

**In short:** “We send someone to the property and give you a documented report so you can rent with confidence.”

### 3. Trust & Transparency

- **Verification badges** on listings that have been verified (renters can filter/sort by verified).
- **Documentation** (photos, videos, 360°, reports) so renters see the real condition before signing.
- **Landlord identity confirmation** (as part of verification) to reduce scam risk.

**In short:** Reduces risk of rental scams and “listing not as described” by tying listings to a real visit and report.

### 4. Owner Tools (Dashboard)

- Add and edit listings, upload media, set price and availability.
- View analytics (views, engagement, inquiries).
- Manage verification requests and display verification badges.
- Respond to inquiries, schedule viewings, manage applications.

**In short:** Gives property owners a place to manage their side of the marketplace and benefit from verification.

### 5. Verification Operator Opportunity

- **For local operators:** Receive verification jobs (visit property, complete checklist, capture media, submit report). Operators are paid per job; they perform the on-site work.

**In short:** Business service to a third audience: “We send you verification jobs; you do the visit and report; we pay you.”

### 6. Additional / Future Services

- **Premium listing** for owners (featured placement, more visibility, verification badge eligibility).
- **Premium tenant features** (e.g. priority access, advanced filters, saved search alerts).
- **APIs** for partners (property management systems, external verification requests).
- **White-label / partnerships:** e.g. university student housing portals, corporate relocation.
